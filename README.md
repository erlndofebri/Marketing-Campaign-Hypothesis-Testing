# Marketing Campaign Hypothesis Testing
The goal of this project is to test the several promotions type whether they can bring significantly higher sales or not

## Comparing Promotion 1 vs Promotion 2 in an Hypothesis Test
- H0: Promotion 1 and Promotion 2 have same Sales Revenue
- H1: Promotion 1 and Promotion 2 do not have same Sales Revenue

#### Result:
- P-Value : 0.0000
- Sufficient to reject H0

- t-test(1 vs 2): 6.427528670907475
- Pvalue(1 vs 2): 4.143296816749853e-10

Our P-Value is close to 0 which suggests that there is good evidence to REJECT the Null Hypothesis. Meaning there is a statistical difference between the two groups. Our threshold rejectings the Null is usually less than 0.05. Our t-test shows that the marketing performances for these two groups are significantly different and that promotion group 1 outperforms promotion group 

## Comparing Promotion 1 vs Promotion 3 in an Hypothesis Test
- H0: Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 have same Sales Revenue
- H1: Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 do not have same Sales Revenue

#### Result :
- P-Value : 0.1206
- Insufficient to reject H0

- t-test(1 vs 3): 1.556022430775863
- Pvalue(1 vs 3): 0.12058631176434842

Our P-Value is greater than 0.05 which suggests that there is no good evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis. Meaning there is no statistical difference between the two groups.
